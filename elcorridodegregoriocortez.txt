In the country of Karnes, 
Look what has happened; 
The Major Sheriff died,
Leaving Román badly wounded.

It must have been two in the 
afternoon
When people arrived;
They said to one another,
"It is not known who killed him."

They went around asking questions,
About half an hour afterward, 
They found that the wrongdoer
Had been Gregorio Cortez.

Now they have outlawed Cortez,
Throughout the whole state;
Let him be taken, dead or alive; 
He has killed several men.

They said Gregorio Cortez, 
With his pistol in his hand,
"I don’t regret that I killed him; 
I regret my brother’s death."

Then said Gregorio Cortez, 
And his soul was all a flame, 
"I don’t regret that I killed him;
A man must defend himself."

The Americans were coming, 
They were whiter than a dove, 
From the fear that they had 
Of Cortez and of his pistol. 

Then the Americans said, 
Then they said fearfully,
"Come, let us follow the trail;
The wrongdoer is Cortez."

They set the bloodhounds on him, 
So they could follow his trail, 
But trying to overtake  Cortez
Was like following a star. 

He struck out for Gonzales
Without showing any fear,
"Follow me, cowardly rangers, 
I am Gregorio Cortez."

From Belmont, he went to the 
ranch,  
They succeeded in surrounding 
him, 
Quite a few more than three hundred, 
But there he jumped their corral. 

When he jumped their corral, 
According to what we hear,
They got into a gunfight,
And he killed them another sheriff, 

Then said Gregorio Cortez, 
With his pistol in his hand, 
"Don’t run, you cowardly rangers, 
From just one Mexican."

Gregorio Cortez went out, 
He went towards Laredo
They decided not to follow 
Because they were afraid of him.

Then said Gregorio Cortez, 
"What is the use of your scheming?
You cannot catch me,
Even with those bloodhounds."

Then the Americans said, 
"If we catch you with him, what 
shall we do?
If we fight him man to man, 
Very few of us will return."

Over by El Encinal, 
According to what we hear, 
They made him a corral, 
And he killed them another sheriff. 

Then said Gregorio Cortez, 
Shooting out a lot of bullets,
"I have weathered thunderstorms;
This little mist doesn’t bother me."

Now he has met a Mexican;
He says to him haughtily,
"tell me the news;
I am Gregorio Cortez."

"It is said that because of me 
Many people have been killed;
I will surrender now
Because such things are not right."

Cortez says to Jesús,
"At last you are going to see it;
Go tell the rangers
To come and arrest me."

All the rangers were coming, 
Coming so fast they even flew, 
For they wanted to get 
The thousand dollars they were 
offered. 

When they surrounded the house, 
Cortez suddenly appeared before
	them, 
"You will take me if I’m willing, 
But not any other way."

Then the Major Sheriff said, 
As if he was going to cry, 
"Cortez, hand over your weapons;
We are not going to kill."

Then said Gregorio Cortez,
Shouting to them in a loud voice,
"I won’t surrender my arms
Until I am in a cell."

Then said Gregorio Cortez,
He said in his godly voice, 
"I won’t surrender my arms
Until I’m inside a jail."

Now they have taken Cortez,
Now matters are at an end, 
His poor family
Are suffering in their hearts.

Now with this I say farewell, 
In the shade of a cypress tree;
This is the end of the singing. 
of the ballad of Cortez.

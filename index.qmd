## A Brief History of Gregorio Cortez
Here in Karnes, Gonzales, the story begins with an unwarranted visit by Sheriff Morris, who was searching for Mexicans about a stolen horse. This interaction led to the death of Román and a shoot-out between Gregorio Cortez and Sheriff Morris, which left only Gregorio standing. 

The ballad of Gregorio Cortez begins with Gregorio as a wanted man.

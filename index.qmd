## A Brief History of Gregorio Cortez

Here in Karnes County, Texas the story begins with an unwarranted visit by Sheriff Morris, who was searching for Mexicans about a stolen horse. This interaction led to the death of Román and a shoot-out between Gregorio Cortez and Sheriff Morris, which left only Gregorio standing. 

On June 22, 1901, law enforcement finally caught up to Gregorio. He surrendered himself to the Governor of the State and went to trial for the death of Sheriff Morris and Glover. However, no judge or jury could find Gregorio guilty of the death of Sheriff Morris since Gregorio acted in self-defense. Unfortunately, Gregorio made many enemies due to the deaths of both sheriffs—where many wanted to see Gregorio lynched. 

On January 1, 1905, Gregorio received a jail sentence for the death of Sheriff Glover. 

Gregorio received a pardon in July 1913 by Governor O.B. Colquitt and left his prison cell on July 14, 1913.

In 1916, Gregorio Cortez passed away. 

Here ends the ballad of Gregorio Cortez, but his legend continues as a hero of South Texas borderlands.
